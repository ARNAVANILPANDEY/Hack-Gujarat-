About it:-
An application made using the technology of Augmented Reality and AI/ML. It’s scope is to improve the Health Sector of 
society and spreading awareness about this pandemic situation. This will answer basic queries regarding novel corona virus.
This application "Rakshak" illuminates you with every fact you need to know about Corona while also quenching your doubts
about the same by answering all your questions. Every time you open the app you'll be enlightened with a new fact about the
virus. It is also fully interactive and involving to operate.
  
Future Goals:-
We are trying to integrate with python(suggestions are always welcome)text-to-speech, as 
the plugin used is IBM Watson which poses a challenge as it is not able to pick up and understand
the accent we use for speaking.

As this is only a social service application, which answers the users basic queries about
novel corona virus and keeps the user updated about the pandemic situation. We are now focusing
on the different areas of application of AR incorporated with AI/ML.

For education part:
It can serve as the go-to spot for children's educational needs in these hours of crisis.
With numerous subjects to choose from, it serves the demand of continuous learning and education.

For business part:
While business profession also remains a hard  aspect, Rakshak eases the work by reading out slides
of presentation serving the professional needs at the comfort of home at customised times.

Lastly, at all, we requests other members of this community to guide us and contribute in the
successful contribution of the project.
